				<p>I am predominately comfortable at using C++ although I have varying experience with a number of languages.</p>
				<p>Currently I am a student at the University of Waterloo, studying computer science.  I love any backend work and am interested in a multitude of fields.  Combinations of different fields that complement each other excite me, and I am currently starting to explore computer vision/AI/machine learning.  I am also looking for opportunities to force myself to work with web technologies :)</p>
				<p>Check out what I'm currently working on through my <button class="tab3">projects</button> page, and feel free to connect with me!</p>
