				<p>I am predominately comfortable at using C++ although I have varying experience with a number of languages.</p>
				<p>Currently I am a student at the University of Waterloo, studying computer science.  I have a good foundation in the fundamentals and as such I am looking to learn and explore most fields in order to broaden my knowledge and become a stronger programmer.</p>
				<p>Check out what I'm currently working on through my <button class="tab3">projects</button> page, and feel free to connect with me!</p>
